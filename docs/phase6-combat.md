# Phase 6: Basic Combat (Optional)

**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Goal:** Learn event systems and inter-entity interactions

## Overview

Phase 6 adds combat mechanics, allowing units to fight each other. This optional phase introduces events and entity interactions.

## What We'll Build

- `Stats` component (HP, attack, defense)
- Combat system (move onto enemy → attack)
- Death system (despawn at 0 HP)
- Health bar UI
- Win/lose conditions
- GameOver state

## Key Concepts

- Events (`EventReader`, `EventWriter`)
- Entity despawning
- UI rendering (health bars)
- Parent-child entity relationships
- State cleanup with `OnExit`

## Documentation Coming Soon

This phase will be documented once implementation is complete.
