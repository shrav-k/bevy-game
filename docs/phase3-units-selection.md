# Phase 3: Units and Selection

**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Goal:** Learn queries, markers, and component-based logic

## Overview

Phase 3 adds units to the game and implements selection mechanics. We'll spawn player and enemy units and learn how to select them with mouse clicks.

## What We'll Build

- `Unit` component with factions (Player/Enemy)
- Spawn player units (blue) and enemy units (red)
- `Selected` marker component for tracking selection
- Visual feedback for selected units
- Faction-aware selection (only select your own units)

## Key Concepts

- Marker components (zero-sized types)
- Query filters (`With<T>`, `Without<T>`)
- Adding/removing components dynamically
- Entity hierarchy (parent-child relationships)

## Documentation Coming Soon

This phase will be documented once implementation is complete.
