# Phase 5: Simple AI

**Status:** 📋 Planned
**Goal:** Learn system scheduling and basic game AI

## Overview

Phase 5 adds artificial intelligence for enemy units. The AI will make decisions during the enemy turn, creating a complete gameplay loop.

## What We'll Build

- `AIControlled` marker component
- Simple AI logic (move toward nearest player)
- AI decision system
- AI movement execution
- Turn completion detection

## Key Concepts

- Querying multiple component combinations
- System ordering and sets
- Time-based logic (`Res<Time>`)
- Randomness in ECS
- AI decision-making patterns

## Documentation Coming Soon

This phase will be documented once implementation is complete.
